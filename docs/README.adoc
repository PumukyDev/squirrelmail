= Mail Server Configuration

== Postfix

=== Ports

Postfix starts the SMTP service (port 25/TCP)

=== Configuration

The main configuration file for Postfix is /etc/postfix/main.cf

=== User Types

In Postfix, users can be local (users with an account on the machine) or virtual 
(users whose credentials are stored in files, databases, directory services, etc.).

=== Mailboxes

Two main mailbox formats exist: **mbox** and **maildir**.

==== mbox
- All messages are stored in a single file per user.
- Requires file locking to prevent corruption during simultaneous access.
- Commonly used in UNIX systems with inbox files at /var/mail/username or /var/spool/mail/username.
- In Postfix, the default inbox is set by mail_spool_directory=/var/mail.
- Local mail reading moves messages from the inbox to a mailbox file in $HOME.
- To store messages directly in $HOME, set home_mailbox=filename.

==== maildir
- Each message is stored in a separate file with a unique name, avoiding the need for file locking.
- The mailbox is a directory (usually Maildir) with three subdirectories:
  * tmp: pending messages
  * new: new messages
  * cur: read messages
- To use maildir in Postfix, set home_mailbox=Maildir/ (note the trailing slash).
- Messages are stored in $HOME/Maildir/new, and read messages in $HOME/Maildir/cur.


== Dovecot

So far, we have accessed user mailboxes by logging into the same server locally, but this is not common practice. Typically, users access their messages remotely from their workstations using a POP/IMAP server for delivery.

=== Ports

TCP/110 (POP), TCP/143 (IMAP)

=== Mailboxes

By default, mbox-type mailboxes are set with the inbox located in /var/mail/username. It is suggested that when the client reads messages, they are organized within a folder in the user's $HOME named mail, but this depends on the client application, which may organize the read messages in a different location. This default configuration is set with the parameter mail_location.

Default configuration for mbox mailboxes:
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

The method to set the mailbox depends on its type.

Mailbox in mbox format:
If the mailbox uses the mbox format, we would use:
mail_location = mbox:~/folder:INBOX=/var/mail/%u

Where:
- The mailbox type is mbox.
- The location of each user's mailbox is ~/folder in their home directory. In POP connections, read messages are organized inside this folder (usually in a subfolder named INBOX). In IMAP connections, messages always remain on the server and are not downloaded.
- The inbox is located at /var/mail/%u, which corresponds to /var/mail/username.

Maildir-type mailboxes:
If using maildir-type mailboxes, we would use:
mail_location = maildir:~/Maildir

=== Configuration

The main configuration file for Dovecot is /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf. 
Additionally, 10-mail.conf and 10-auth.conf have been configured in this repository.

Default Dovecot Configuration:
Among the various Dovecot files and the default settings, we find these values:
# enabled protocols
protocols = "imap pop3"
# Mailbox types and locations
mail_location = mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
# Authentication mechanisms.
# Supports: plain, login, cram-md5, digest-md5, ntlm, ...
auth_mechanisms = plain
